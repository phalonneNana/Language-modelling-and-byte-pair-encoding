# Language-modelling-and-byte-pair-encoding
This work presents a comprehensive approach to language identification and language similarity analysis using character-level trigram language models and byte-pair encoding (BPE). Our goal is to accurately classify sentences into their respective languages and explore the similarities between languages based on subword tokenization. The language identification task involves training language models specific to each language and achieving a high accuracy of 90.8% in identifying languages in the test data. The BPE technique allows for the analysis of language similarity by identifying shared subword units between languages. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in accu- rate language identification and capturing language similarities without relying on external NLP toolkits. This work contributes to the advancement of language processing and enables more robust language analysis tasks.
